I have developed a two player Tic-tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as a 3rd task in web development internship. By implementing functions to handle user Web clicks, track game state, and check for winning conditions, you can create an interactive and engaging tic-tac-toe game. With these technologies and functionalities, users can play against each other, aiming to get three markers in a row to win the game.
